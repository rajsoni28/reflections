Reflections 3 for the Git hub tutorial

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Ans: Because I might be working with another collaborator who may have committed and I may not want to bring those chages in just yet

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	Forks: When I want to close someone else's repository on GitHub
	Clones: When I want to make a copy of the repository on my local machine
	Branch: When I want to make changes, run experiments etc.
